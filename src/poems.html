The poem describes the scene of bidding farewell to a friend, Xin Jian, at the Furong Tower. The poem depicts a cold, rainy night, with the river connecting to the Wu region, making the atmosphere lonely. The second line of the poem describes the next morning, with the friend walking alone among the Chu Mountains. Chu Mountain was a region in southern China at the time, with many high mountains. The meaning here is that after the friend leaves, the Chu Mountains seem even more lonely.  The last two lines of the poem express the poet's concern for his friend. Luoyang was a big city at that time, and the poet's friends and relatives were all there. They might ask about Xin Jian's well-being. The poet uses "a piece of ice heart in a jade pot" to describe his concern for his friend. The ice heart represents the poet's inner calm, while the jade pot symbolizes purity. The meaning here is that the poet's concern for his friend is sincere and deep.</p>

The poet hopes that readers can understand the brevity of life and grasp every moment, striving to pursue what is truly valuable instead of focusing solely on material wealth. This poem expresses the philosophy of life with simple words, and for an 8-year-old child, it teaches the importance of cherishing time and seizing opportunities.</p>

        <p>[宋代] 苏轼</p>
        <p>横看成岭侧成峰，远近高低各不同。不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中。</p>

The poem describes the beautiful scenery of Mount Lu, which is located in Jiangxi Province, China, and is a famous tourist attraction. The poet uses simple words to depict the various aspects of Mount Lu's scenery, such as the distance, height, and peaks. The poet wants to express that when we are in the midst of beautiful scenery, it is difficult for us to see its true appearance. This is because we are too close to it and cannot see the whole picture clearly. This poem teaches us to appreciate the beauty from a higher and farther perspective, so that we can better understand its charm.</p>

The poet reminds us that it is easy to learn when we are young, but difficult to master new knowledge as we grow older. Therefore, we must cherish our time and not take every moment lightly. The poet uses the metaphor of spring grass and autumn leaves to illustrate the passage of time. Before we even realize that the spring grass is dreaming in the pond, the leaves of the wisteria tree in front of the steps are already making autumn sounds. This shows that time passes very quickly, and we must seize the time to learn and grow.</p>

Here, the poet uses the life cycle of flowers to compare the parting and reunion in human life, indicating that the parting in life is not heartless but is meant for a better beginning.
